INTERFACE NOTES: (3/10/2025)
    This series of games and the interface were designed primarily for computer gamers. Specifically, 
    gamers that are fond of the military history of World War II. The games cover various aspects of
    combat (ground, naval and air). Two games are meant to be played head-to-head with two human players
    (often called a hot-seat game). One is an arcade "shooter".
    A lot of the design elements were inspired by the "Pirate Games" example provided by the instructor.
    I've used a similar structure for the navigation bar, and made sure that it is the same across all pages.
    The color scheme chosen was a selection of colors (sky blue, khaki, blue and green) that would either be used
    on some of the military equipment featured in the game, or would complement the graphics and pictures used.

    Just for fun, I wanted to include a little video clip from one of my favorite all-time war movies, "Dr. Strangelove"
    by Stanley Kubruick. It is a 12-second clip from the movie featuring one of the most ironic lines ever spoken in a film,
    and it was the inspiration for the title of this web project and main page.
