------------------------------
    GAME DESCRIPTIONS
------------------------------
1)  Tanks 1943 is a 2-player hot-seat strategy game inspired by the Milton-Bradley board game "Tank Battle". The background subject of the game is World War II tank combat in Europe and Africa. The game shares some elements of "checkers". 

2)  Point Luck is a 2-player hot-seat strategy game inspired by the Avalon Hill board game "Midway". The name comes from the 
code name given to the rendezvous point of the US Navy ships northeast of the Midway archapelago. The background subject of 
this game is the naval and air battle that took place near Midway in the Central PAcific ocean between June 4-7 1942.  

3)  Luftwaffe Aces is a single player arcade style scrolling shooter game based on air combat in World War II. It was inspired by the 
CapCom video games "1942" and "Midway 1943".

------------------------------
    FUTURE PLANS / UPGRADES
------------------------------
The two player games "Tanks 1943" and "Point Luck" will at some point be upgraded to include the option to play against the computer.
Both of those board games wil use square grids in this version for movement; future development may include switching to a hexagonal
grid, which is more realistic for uniform movement in 6 directions. 

Luftwaffe Aces may only include some basic enemies at this point and a limited number of missions or "screens". It is focused on the
air combat that occured over the European theater in World War II, beginning with the Spanish Civil War. Future development will
involve adding more enemy planes; expanding to the Pacific Theater; and the ability to upgrade/switch the player-controlled aircraft. 
There might also be campaigns or multiple scenarios on a particular subject, such as the Battle of Britain or the D-Day landings.
