            This is a two-player strategy game of naval and air comnbat in World War II.
            It is loosely based on the Avalon Hill board game "Midway" from the 1970's.
            It has some characteristics of the classic board game "Battleship"; one extra
            wrinkle is that the ships can, and will move. Players will spend a lot of time
            in a desperate sort of "hide-and-seek" routine. The Japanese player's goal is to
            bring a landing force of troops to Midway Island. The American player needs to
            stop them at all costs. The Japanese have overwhelming numbers of ships and planes,
            but while they think they are making a surprise move, the Americans knew of their
            plans and sent what little forces they had to stop them. "Point Luck" was the name
            given by US Navy codebreakers to the spot where the American ships would meet to
            hopefully stop the Japanese force. IN the actual battle, there was a lot of luck
            involved and that will be recreated in this game with the use of random number
            generators.  <button id="start" onclick="document.location='Midway.html'"> Launch Game</button>
